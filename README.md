## CRISP: A Deep Learning approach for GC×GC-TOFMS Contour ROI Identification, Simulation and untargeted metabolomics Profiling##
  
1. GENERAL INFORMATION 
  
CRISP is the novel platform that integrates multiple existing and new state-of-art deep learning (DL) platforms for untargeted profiling of Two-Dimensional Gas Chromatography and Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (GC×GC-TOFMS)-generated data in terms of contour  data. The open source software toolkit is responsible for feature detection, simulation, data enhancement and classification of GC×GC-TOFMS-generated contour for the untargeted metabolite profiling. The integrated platform has novel ability to automatically construct aggregate feature representative contours (AFRC*) from group of supplied contour data belonging to different classes/groups to reduce manual  selection biasness and subsequently auto-identify contrasting region of interest (ROIs) within these contour based on AFRIs. These ROIs can be algorithmically detected and stacked together, using our own algorithm termed as “DeepStacking*” to create a new representative feature map that maximizes the contrasting features and maximizes the profiling accuracy for each group during classifier training. The Integrated Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is the main engine that simulates the synthetic Contour data based on the real samples. The Integrated GAN in use is a modified version of SGAN/WGAN that minimizes gradient vanishing and Lipschitz Constraint contained in general SGAN and WGANs. The synthesized output are computed for frechet inception distance (FID) to evaluate their quality of likeliness to the source data. The integrated modules has the framework for efficient high resolution contour image synthesis (64×64 - 512×512) resolution along with customizable contour intensity manipulation. The synthesized images can subjected to contour image super resolution (SR) model based on Cascading Residual Network. The Contour Profiler’s SR network is fully customizable. It has be customized by default and trained using our own Contour-like HR dataset to maximize the model’s capabilities to enhance contour image data. The Classifier is collection of customized version of state-of-art Convolutional neural network (CNN) including VGG16/VGG19/Inception/RasNet/DenseNet for detecting features and obtaining maximum efficient models.  Instead of usual 224×224 Input dimensions, the model is able to input (224×244 or 512×512) dimensions along with customizable model optimizer feature to maximize the contour feature detection capabilities. All models once trained can be restored, continued training and used independently to inference their corresponding inputs. All models created by Contour Profiler have their summary, ROIs Deep stacking co-ordinates, logs and training history including models losses, FIDs*  and QScores*  stored whenever applicable. Taken together, the ContourProfiler provides an all-in-one open source integrated platform for advanced profiling of non-targeted GC×GC-TOFMS Contour data.
