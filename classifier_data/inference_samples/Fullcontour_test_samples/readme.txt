Crop the whole Contur samples from ChromaTOF using the 1A: Manual ROI selection tool --> Load Template image for ROI selection --> GUI ROI Selection --> Extract ROIs --. Goto d) Classifier and set the test image path to the extracted full fram contour folder


==>The unknown GCxGC-TOFMS contour samples extracted using same protocol should be pre-processed accordingly before using the pre-traiend model for further training or inferencing.

==> Model to apply for these samples:  Crisp_root\classifier_data\trained_weights\MixCB_fullcontour_original or  \MixCB_fullcontour_simulated
